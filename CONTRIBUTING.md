# Contributing to Wii Shop Channel Music

The Wii Shop Music extension is intended to be a fun and simple browser extension. With that in mind, there are two main rules for contributing code or submitting issues:

1. The list of shopping sites is now found at [corbindavenport/shop-list](https://github.com/corbindavenport/shop-list), please do not submit pull requests or requests for new sites in this repository.
1. **No major new features.** I have no plans or desire to implement new major features, besides those already listed on the [issues page](https://github.com/corbindavenport/wii-shop-extension/issues).
2. **No new music.** The extension already has 10 tracks included, and that will probably be it. The [ability to import custom music](https://github.com/corbindavenport/wii-shop-extension/issues/22) may be implemented in the future.

Future development on the extension will mainly focus on bug fixes and any changes required to keep up with evolving browser standards.
