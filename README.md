# Wii Shop Channel Music

This is a browser extension that plays the [Wii Shop Channel theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyjUmv1gJEg) in the background when you visit a shopping website, detected by [Shopping Sites List](https://github.com/corbindavenport/shop-list). You can also select the music from the 3DS eShop, DSi Shop, Wii Shop Banner/Home, Wii U eShop, Mii Channel (Wii or 3DS), Coconut Mall, and the ["Wii Shop Wednesday" song from Nirvana The Band The Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qnI1WrlnU). Wii Shop Channel Music uses [shop-list](https://github.com/corbindavenport/shop-list) for auto-detection of shopping websites.
